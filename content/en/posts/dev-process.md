<strong>Let's Begin </strong> 

Whenever I was starting a new full-stack web project I always felt overwhelmed and sometimes even lost, with the amount of things to do, to keep track of and to consider. My approach to building web apps or any software project in general was off, and it is was hurting my productivity and my right down sanity. I knew that I had to put some order in the process and that diving heads down into the code editor was not a very good approach. 

I have spend a lot of time and energy researching to find a consistent universal process for building a full-stack web project but unfortunately I haven't found one to satisfy my needs and my way of doing things, so I've decided to establish one on my own.

here I want to share with you how I go about making full-stack projects for the web, I don't want you to take it as an authoritative guide but rather my personal take on how to tackle a complex task that would inspire you to think and build a method that would fit your needs and specificity. 

My Process is made of 10 major steps:

1. <strong>Understand what you're doing:</strong> determine the reason of being of the website.
2. <strong>Define the scope:</strong> how big is this project going to be, how much time and resources will be allocate.
3. <strong>Choose the tech:</strong> what technology stack with will be appropriate. 
4. <strong>Wireframe the project:</strong> defining all the elements and establishing how they interconnect.
5. <strong>Gather the content:</strong> creating real content for the media, the text, the links etc..
6. <strong>Define the visual elements:</strong> define the visual identity, the colours, the fonts, build a consistent visual style. build a mockup.
7. <strong>Write the code:</strong> chunk the project into section, initialise git repo, define the 20%-80% rule. design database, server architecture.  
8. <strong>Test & Fix & Tweak:</strong> Start testing find bugs, clean the source code and add comments and documentation
9. <strong>Deploy & Monitor:</strong> One everything is satisfactory time to deploy. for the first 24hours I will keep my eyes open to monitor if any crashes happen. use this tool for monitoring the performance and if the website is live.
10. <strong>Schedule iterations:</strong> schedule the next iteration to add the new features you just thought of while building the website.


### Now the we've outlined the process, let's elaborate little more in depth into each one:

## 1. Understand What Youâ€™re Making.
This Phase is the most important one, it's where we define where things go, the goal here is to know exactly what we are trying to achieve with this project. in this initial stage we must define what purpose does the website serve and  what are its objectives, this step is very crucial for the success of the development of the project. 

to define the end goal here are the questions to answer:
- Who is this website for?


## 2. Define The Scope 
development time.  ressources scope. maintainance scope. is the project feasability of the project. how many people you need in the dev team. the modernizing plan . define the constraints for the mvp th 80-20 rule. 
create an iteration list your will need it

## 3. Choose the Tech
choose your tech stack, your dev tools, you project management tools. all the tools you need to work with. 

## 4. WireFrame The Project
architecture the backend, data flow chart, user flow chart, site map, user journey,

## 5. Gather the Content
gather the content based on your wire farme. 

## 6. Define Visual Elements
define the palette. fonts, feel , mood board stat with that. 

## 7. Write the Code
chunk the execution
initilize a repo 
code standard unit testing 
branches team 
time to write the code.  where to start. 
 constrain yourself to mvp. if you have new ideas put them in the iteration list, dont dont implement them. 

## 8. Test & Tweak 
test and fix the code. optimize the code. clean it , comment it, add docs. 

## 9. Deploy & Monitor
time to deploy and send away, make the world see it and use it. 

## 10. Schedule iterations
now let schedule the iterations by priority first. and do them one feature at a time. priority goes for bugs, and fixes only them can you takle the new features you so eargly want to implement
