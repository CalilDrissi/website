Every web designer should have a few impressive case studies in their back pocket. But crafting them to win clients isn’t simple (trust us, we’ve been around the block many times).

It’s only after years of trial and error at Neon Hive that we’ve found a working format: A sleek composition of showcase images that flow together as the written story unfolds.

For you designers out there, the design will be the easy part. Visuals are your forte. But how does a web designer not only structure, but write the perfect case study? 

Sadly, screenshots paired with brief detailings of your favorite projects are not enough to breed success. Your case studies need smart structure, compelling copy, and engaging design if they’re ever going to win a potential client’s trust.


## what is the importance of a case study? 

All great case studies feature notable client projects, a definitive narrative structure, and an engaging visual design. That, and decent writing — something all web designers should learn, for several reasons.

The above case study characteristics are essential. Use them together, and you’re guaranteed to breed case studies that win more design clients. 

To kickstart your process, note down this main goal: Case studies must describe the process you took to solve a challenge or close the gap from the observed to the desired state for the client.‍

To achieve this goal, in a case study, you need to pave an enticing pathway for prospective clients to scroll down and explore your services. Consider it your “yellow brick road.”
