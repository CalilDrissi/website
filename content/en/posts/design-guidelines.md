Good web design involves more than an esthetically pleasing appearance. Luckily, there are some nearly universal rules of that can help.This article will teach you how to follow the ten rules of thumb in your design work so you can further improve the usability, utility, and desirability of your designs.

## Know Your User and Their Needs

a website is only as good as the user’s experience. In a way, this seems obvious. If you’re not designing for the user, then who are you designing for? But how this basic principle  dictates design decisions has powerful implications.

Someone on a travel site looking to book a reservation for a trip to Alaska, for example, is coming to the site maybe once a year and comparing it against others they’re exploring. To stand out, the site must surface accommodations quickly and provide enough visual interest to hold the user’s attention. Discoverability, in other words, is paramount. A website designed as a B2B tool for a customer service agent, on the other hand, has a very different purpose, and thus a very different set of constraints.

“Perhaps that customer service person is gauged by the amount of time they spend on the phone,” Schultz explained. “They can only be on the phone for two minutes, for example.”

In that case, the time threshold guides the entire process, filtering out any design options that don’t load fast and yield information quickly.
